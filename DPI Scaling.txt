For simple projects, add 'DPIAware' to the Tag property on the Form to attempt a scaling fix on high resolution displays.
You may have to multiply resize event values by $tscale.
Sometimes the export does not include a 'Size' properly in the XML if the control has not been resized. You may need to manually add or change the value.
To enable VisualStyle, add 'VisualStyle' to the Tag property on the Form.
See Calc.fbs for an example.

Tags are comma seperated.
