For simple projects, add 'DPIAware' to the Tag property on the Form to attempt a scaling fix on high resolution displays.
You may have to multiply resize event values by $ctscale (height, width, top, left or size[] location[]).
Sometimes the export does not include a 'Size' properly in the XML if the control has not been resized. Resize all controls by at least one pixel.
To enable VisualStyle, add 'VisualStyle' to the Tag property on the Form.
See Calc.fbs for an example.

Tags are comma seperated.
