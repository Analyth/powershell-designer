For simple projects, set the value of the Tag properly to 'DPIAware' on the Form to attempt a scaling fix on high resolution displays.
You may have to multiply resize event values by $tscale.
Sometimes the export does not include a 'Size' properly in the XML if the control has not been resized. You may need to manually add or change the value.
To enable VisualStyle, add VisualStyle on the Form. 

Tags are comma seperated.
